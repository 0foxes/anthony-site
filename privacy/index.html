        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The right to privacy has long been recognised, so much so that it was even enumerated in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Before that, it was found tucked away in numerous constitutions and bills of rights around the world.</p>

        <p>But what if I told you that no one today is free from arbitrary interference with their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/data-brokers-tracking/">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927">family</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/18/smart-home-security/">home</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">correspondence</a>? That those who expose injustice face attacks upon their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59608641">honour</a> and <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/trump-once-said-edward-snowden-should-be-executed-now-he-may-pardon-him">reputation</a>? That none were protected under laws that enable these intrusions?</p>

        <hr>
        <p>"But why should I care?" is a common refrain. Prevalent data collection and privacy policies everywhere have desensitized modern internet users to violations of their privacy. However, real consequences can and do happen. Below are some minor and major examples of how you can be negatively impacted by a lack of internet privacy today, as well as a prediction of the future if we continue on our current path.</p>
        <h2>The Present</h2>
        <p>The most obvious example—which most people are familiar with—is identity theft. Someone posts too much personal information online, or their personal information is sold by a company they trusted, and hackers are then free to access their bank accounts or credit cards.</p>
        <p>But there are more insidious methods of parting you with your money. For example, several major companies currently use big data to predict how much each customer is willing to pay for a product. They then display a personalised price slightly under that to the customer.</p>
        <p>There are scarier scenarios. If you have family or friends in a dictatorship and your conversations are intercepted (on either the sending or receiving end), it could lead to consequences for them. In some countries, you can be executed just for outside communication.</p>
        <p>Finally, never underestimate your own government—or more accurately, its employees. You may not have broken any laws, but individual analysts can directly access your digital data in most governments with little oversight. Do you trust every analyst to do the right thing?</p>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>Imagine a world where everything you did online was tied to your credit score. Your social media posts. Your internet browsing. Your individual online purchases. Far from being a dystopian reality, American companies have begun initial trials of the systems listed.</p>
        <p>If you've ever gotten ads after searching something up, this is similar but far worse. Imagine ads that knew you better than anyone. Perfect suggestions, billboards that change to target you when you pass, and personalised sales on products you talk about on the phone.</p>
        <p>With the rise of cloud storage, future data breaches will be beyond devastating. Criminals once had to break into your house to steal your data. Soon, they'll be able to guess your security questions—thanks to social media activity—and download all of your data in seconds.</p>
        <p>It's far easier to give up something than to get it back, and this applies to internet privacy as well. If citizens decide someday that data collection has gone too far, they'll be powerless to stop it—just like how the NSA's activities were only legalised after discovery.</p>

        <h2>How to Act</h2>
        <p>There are many actions you can take to ensure your internet privacy. Many of them also benefit and ensure other users' privacy.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Privacy Policies: Most times, companies tell you what data they collect in their privacy policy. You just have to read them carefully.</li>
            <li>Service Selection: Furthermore, you should stop using services that collect unnecessary personal data. Let them know why you stopped!</li>
            <li>Smart Devices: Do locks really need to have internet? Smart devices are juicy targets for hackers and often stop working without power.</li>
            <li>Use a VPN: Although not perfect, using a Virtual Private Network can hide your origin from websites and make you harder to track.</li>
            <li>Emissions Control: Your phone uses gps, bluetooth, and wifi to track you when those are enabled. Turn them off when not being used.</li>
            <li>Cover Up: Even if your devices are hacked, you can reduce the damage by covering cameras. Similarly, try not to use smart speakers.</li>
            <li>Be Proactive: Don't want your data kept? End up on Google? Ask for data deletion—many companies are legally obligated to comply.</li>
            <li>Spread the Word: Often, companies target privacy-conscious users through their friends. Let your friends know about these  privacy tips!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Organisations</h2>
        <p>If you've read and considered all the suggestions in the previous section, that's great! But it doesn't end there. There are many other amazing organisations doing great work advocating for digital privacy and other causes that you should check out:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <a href="https://eff.org"><img class="blog-content-img-small" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/EFF_Logo.svg/1200px-EFF_Logo.svg.png"></a>
                <p>The <a href="https://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> bills themselves as the "leading nonprofit defending digital privacy", and many would agree that they are. From building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">titanic systems</a> to crack "unbreakable" ciphers to <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">demonstrating internet tracking</a> with their own trackers, they work around the clock to raise awareness about internet privacy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <a href="https://www.torproject.org"><img class="blog-content-img-small" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Torproject.png"></a>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a> has a narrower focus, but is just as important. Despite receiving funding from the United States government—leading to regular speculation of a hidden agenda—it continues to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)">Tor anonymity network</a>, which allows one to be truly anonymous online. The network has been used by activists, spies, and criminals alike.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <a href="https://www.fsf.org"><img class="blog-content-img-small" src="https://www.fulmina.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/30_The-Free-Software-Foundation-FSF.png"></a>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> has been advocating for computer freedoms since 1985. Such freedoms include the freedom to view your programs' code and change how it works, the freedom to improve it and share it with others, the freedom to repair your own devices, the freedom to browse the internet without intrusive tracking, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">more</a>.</p>

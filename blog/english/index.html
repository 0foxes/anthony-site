        <p>“Noting that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change,” the treaty began hesitantly, as if the authors were afraid, “The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind”. That was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, drafted in May 1992. It was the first treaty of its kind, remarkable for not only recognising climate change as a problem, but also recognising that developed countries had a responsibility to “take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects” since they emitted most of the world’s greenhouse gases (“Framework Convention” 1, 5). It was controversial among first world governments, to say the least (“What Is the Framework Convention?”).</p>

        <p>While governments tried to ignore the Convention, mass protests around the world made that an impossibility. The Berlin Wall had fallen, the Soviet Union had just dissolved, and the zeitgeist of the early 90s was optimistic—so the protesters refused to take no for an answer. Eventually, they were heard. Scientists developed sustainable ways to use natural resources, polluting companies were vilified in the media, and third-world countries purchased green technology at nominal prices. By the 2000s, we were well on our way to a much more sustainable, peaceful, and equal world. At least, that’s one version of what could have happened. History was much different. Climate change is again in the spotlight today, and this article explains 6 hard truths about it that you need to know.</p>

        <h2>1. It’s the End of the World as We Know It (I Don't Feel Fine)</h2>
        <h3>Anthropogenic Climate Change Exists and is Accelerating</h3>
        <p>If you’ve read this far, presumably you believe climate change is real and not a phenomenon either made up by Big Energy to sell more solar panels, solely caused by the release of An Inconvenient Truth, or about to disappear by itself. But just to make sure we’re all on the same page, let’s go over some facts. Earth’s climate has naturally changed in the past, is currently naturally changing, and will naturally change in the future. However, we have increasingly affected Earth since the Industrial Revolution, when humanity started using fossil fuels at scale. Anthropogenic—related to human activity—climate change now far exceeds natural change. We know this because of worldwide atmospheric measurements, millenia-old bubbles trapped in ice cores, and historical data (NASA).</p>

        <p>Even as humanity quibbles over trivialities, we face the impacts of climate change—rising sea levels, regular extreme weather, generally higher temperatures, and more (NASA). Here’s an example. In July 2021, western Germany faced record rains and flooding (Deutsche Welle). Scientists around the world quickly realised that the floods had been more likely to happen because of climate change (Else). Chinese state media, sensing a propaganda opportunity, even ran full-page spreads on how Germany’s democracy was ill-prepared to handle climate change. Just three days later, record- breaking rainfall flooded the Zhengzhou (a major Chinese city) subway, killing 12 (Gan and Yeung). American media happily pointed out the irony, quipping that China was actually the ill-prepared one. Nature would have the last laugh: in September, Hurricane Ida flooded the New York City Subway. This shows how climate change already affects everyone—regardless of your location, belief in it, or politics—and the effects will only get worse in the future as Earth heats up (Somvichian-Clausen).</p>

        <h2>2. We Didn't Start the Fire (the First World Did)</h2>
        <h3>Those Most Affected Contribute the Least</h3>
        <p>We’ve established that climate change affects everyone, but it doesn’t affect everyone equally. Take Kiribati, for example. It’s a scattering of islands in the central Pacific that you’ve probably never heard of. There are just over 100,000 people there, and climate change is a daily reality for every single one of them. Agriculture is a primary source of income, and recent rising sea levels have been destroying the freshwater supply and crops. As a result, several of its residents are famous activists, often confronting oil executives at conferences (Bowers). But the executives aren’t worried. Even if the optimistic target of limiting temperature rise to 1.5ºC was met, Kiribati would be underwater in a few decades—and when was the last time a stateless refugee was invited to a climate conference?</p>

        <p>The average Canadian has the carbon footprint of 40 Kiribatians, yet the entirety of Canada won’t be underwater in decades. Such is the reality of climate change. Pacific island countries are the most threatened by climate change, even though they contribute the least both in total and per capita (Worldometer). Other regions of the world are similar. Africa is in a population boom and running out of water, and Southeast Asia is battered by giant typhoon after typhoon (Somvichian-Clausen). Meanwhile, the Middle East is warming twice as fast as the global average, and some areas of it will be too hot for humans to survive in the future (Vohra). Countries in those regions—barring oil-rich ones with more funds to deal with climate change—contribute a fraction of the amount we do to climate change, but are affected the most by it (Worldometer). Much like how rich countries emit more greenhouse gases, rich citizens also contribute disproportionately more to climate change: you may not own a private jet, but each one that flies makes Earth a tiny bit hotter (Ruiz).</p>

        <h2>3. We Live in the Best of All Possible Worlds</h2>
        <h3>Climate Change Exacerbates Global Inequalities</h3>
        <p>It gets worse. Not only are first world countries currently emitting more greenhouse gases—thus contributing more to climate change—they have historically emitted far more than other countries (Tollefson). While some might say that we need to focus on the current picture of things, the fact remains: every atom of carbon released into the atmosphere has had an effect on the world climate, even if it didn’t show up on the UN’s latest annual emissions report. Now that developed countries have emitted many times their “fair share”, some developing countries are demanding “climate reparations” for their lost economic opportunities before committing to any reduction in emissions (Sommer). This is like holding the room you’re in hostage with a hand grenade. However, if everyone wants developing countries to invest in reducing emissions and no one wants to pay, what are they to do? Why should they reduce emissions if they benefit more from continuing to develop and emit?</p>

        <p>At the COP26 climate conference, the British conference chair boldly proclaimed that “We [should] leave [coal] in the past where it belongs,” to much applause (Harrabin). It was easy for him to say, as the UK was the first to announce a phase-out schedule for coal in 2015. If you live in the first world, you might also think that we should abandon coal as quickly as possible. In our comfortable and modern lives, coal is a relic of the past. The millions of coal labourers and electricity-less citizens of India would disagree. “If there is coal, then we live. If there isn’t any coal, then we don’t,” a coal scavenger observed (Ghosal). The coal they haul every day is a promise of industry and further development, similar to how it heralded those for Britain in the Industrial Revolution. To them—as well as to many in other developing countries, coal is the future (Pachon and Dillon). Their future.</p>

        <h2>4. Insanity: Doing the Same Thing Expecting Different Results</h2>
        <h3>Emissions Reduction Efforts are Far Insufficient</h3>
        <p>If you were paying attention to climate change legislation in 2017, you may recall media furor at Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and its 1.5ºC temperature rise target. You may have been angry. Uncertain. Frustrated. But if you had been paying attention before that, you would have merely been disappointed. The US’ repudiation was only the latest in a long history of countries agreeing to targets with multi-year deadlines—longer than term limit—that they either can’t or won’t meet. Clinton agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, before Bush withdrew in 2001. Its deadline was 2012. If you think Canada was any better, we withdrew right before the deadline because we didn’t want to pay the financial penalty for missing our targets (Panetta).</p>

        <p>Recently, rich countries completely missed a 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion to poor and vulnerable countries by 2020. $100 billion was estimated as the bare minimum that poor countries needed to adapt to climate change, to say nothing of reducing emissions. By various independent estimates, the world scraped up anywhere from 1% to 23% of that—Canada contributing far less than our fair share based on historic emissions, current emissions, population, and relative wealth. Now, the same $100 billion funding goal has been set for 2022 (Timperley). Even if we fulfill that specific pledge, and every country meets all of their national climate pledges, and the figurative stars align, the UN estimates that we are “on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C” by 2100 (UNEP and UNEP DTU Partnership). That’s a bit higher than the 1.5ºC limit needed to stop climate change’s worst effects, or the 2ºC Paris Agreement target (Bowers). Other organisations are less optimistic.</p>

        <h2>5. Fear and Loathing in a Climate-Changed World</h2>
        <h3>Climate Change Increases Local and Global Conflict</h3>
        <p>The effects of climate change are straightforward—at least the direct ones. As global temperatures rise, glaciers, ice caps, and permafrost all melt. Then sea levels rise, coastlines retreat, and some islands even disappear entirely. The winters gradually become warmer, the summers hotter. Extreme weather events also become more common, with tropical storms, flooding, heat waves, and droughts becoming more common year after year (NASA). Finally, politicians spend more and more time talking heatedly about climate change, and solutions that conveniently begin only after the next election. What’s less obvious and publicised are the knock-on effects of climate change. When drought destroys your crops, when flooding devastates your village, when your entire country is too hot to live, how do you survive (Broom)? What do you do? Where do you go? What happens?</p>

        <p>The answer, it seems, is violence. Climate change was a major cause of the fall of Rome, many wars in the 17th century, and more recently, the Syrian Civil War. “Climate change did not cause the conflicts,” as Barack Obama explains, but “drought . . . helped fuel the early unrest in Syria” (Meyer). UC Berkeley and Stanford economists have also estimated that climate change will increase the frequency of intergroup conflict (civil and international war) by up to 69% in 2050 (Hsiang et al. 2). Conflicts also arise when governments work to mitigate the effects of climate change, as in Ethiopia. There, the entire nation is united in anticipation of the new Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile. The largest hydroelectric project in Africa, it will provide clean energy for Ethiopia. The reservoir will also serve as insurance against drought in the years to come. However, downstream countries fear the reduction in water flow, as well as the leverage it gives Ethiopia. Negotiations have stalled, and the Egyptian government has even threatened to go to war (Bearnak and Sugarsan). As inhabitable land decreases and groundwater dwindles, this conflict may be the first of many.</p>

        <h2>6. There's a Warning Sign on the Road Ahead</h2>
        <h3>Individual Actions Like Metal Straws Won’t Save Us</h3>
        <p>The outrage against plastic straws is a perfect microcosm of the problems with our society’s current attitude towards environmental action. First, a vivid call to action—straws kill turtles—that focuses on the wrong things, since straws make up less than 1% of oceanic plastic waste (Haggerty). This is comparable to how the media feeds our nuclear disaster obsession, and we are riveted to our screens as we hear “3.6 Roentgen” (MIT Energy Initiative 15). Later, we go to our anti-nuclear protests—never hearing about the millions of people who die of coal-caused air pollution (Milman), or the child workers who mine the cobalt in our solar panels (Karlsson and Zimmer). Second, the voices missing from the conversation. Most plastic straw bans were passed as a feel-good measure that marginalised disabled people, many of which need straws to drink (Haggerty). Similarly, global calls to ban coal leave developing countries out of the conversation. This brings us to our final parallel: we place undue emphasis on personal actions like reusable straws and air travel, though they cause a fraction of the emissions that entire industries do, like transportation and energy. This plays right into campaigns that aim to redirect our focus from major polluters to our own lifestyle (Mann). Likewise, first world governments implore developing countries to reduce emissions when we should be leading by example and cutting down our disproportionate emissions. We hardly are.</p>

        <p>This is not to say that you shouldn’t care about climate change. The point of this article is not to encourage readers to wallow in self-pity about everything that’s been and passed, but to present an accurate picture of the world today and stir them to action. Individual action can be effective: if enough people demand change, the companies and governments most responsible for climate change can be brought in line with domestic law and international treaties. And if that happens, emissions will be reduced far more than could be effected by any individual change in lifestyle—and better yet, consumers’ emissions will be reduced even if they do not care about climate change. Only then can we bandage the wounds of climate change and look past the smog, to an uncertain future.</p>
